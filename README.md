# Smart NPCs: An Evaluation Framework for LLM-Based NPC Development and Testing

## About The Project
As AI becomes more prevelant in the video game industry, there is an increasing amount of research done on Generative AI-powered Non-Player Characters (NPCs). \
Generative AI-powered NPCs, also known as "Smart NPCs" are connected to a large language to generate textual responses to a player's input, guided by prompts from the developer. \
This new type of development opens a door for more interactive and dynamic NPC bahaviour, in which smart NPCs can adapt to their environment based on the choices made by a player. \
This could give each player a unique experience, as no two interaction with a given player would be exactly the same.

As promising as this area of research is, it brings about a new set of challenges that must be addressed. Generative AI is known to hallucinate, falsify information, and lack emotional depth, \
and so while it's possible to create more dynamic environments, it is challenging to create individual smart NPCs that have consistent personalities. 

AI guardrails can be implemented that act as a digital filter, ensuring user inputs and LLM outputs remain within boundaries established by the developer. These guardrails help maintain \
appropriate content, improve player safety, and enforce consistent character behaviour.

## Features
- Hierarchial Content Generation that builds content using previously generated content. The hierarchy structure is as follows:
  - System prompts: Imforms the model that it will be protraying a designated character from a video game. (the character being portrayed depends on input from the user). \
    A series of isntructions is included that detail rules for formatting, length of responses, and general contraints.
    - Currently only the character "Geralt of Rivia" from "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" is available. More characters to me added soon.
  - World Prompt: Tells the model to generate a description of the world that the chat will take place in.
  - Region Prompt:
  - Character Prompt: 
- Connected to open-source large language models.
- Saves chat logs for later review.
