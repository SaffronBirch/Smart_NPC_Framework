# '''
# NOTES
# Users can input their own information into each field, or they can upload a text document which will 
# automatically populate the fields based on the provided information.

# Personality traits are chosen from a drop down menu that filters the traits based on the keyboard inputs
# to make finding specific traits easier.

# Relationships are defined by populating a selection of radio buttons with previously created NPCs (if any).
# If no other NPCs have been created, a button, when clicked, takes the user back to the NPC profile screen where
# they can create another NPC. Or they have the option to just describe a relationship with another character in a text box.
# If the text box is used instead, then that characters attributes are automatically use to generate a new NPC by the system
# and placed in the world.
# When an NPC is clicked on, a text box drops down below where the user can enter the nature of their relationship.
